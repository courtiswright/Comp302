This is a stack so the ';' is the last thing pushed on. As soon as I found the ';', I find a rule that has only one match. Therefore, I can reduce:
<arglist> : ';'
c
,
b
,
a

Reduce again: ',' id <arglist> reduced to arglist
<arglist> : ,c;
b
,
a

Reduce again: ',' id <arglist> reduced to arglist
<arglist> : ,b,c;
a

Reduce again: id <arglist> reduces to <args<
<args>
