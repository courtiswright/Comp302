Template --> foo

I have another page where I want to include the contents of foo.
To transclude this:
	{{foo}} --> get the content of foo and replace this with it.

But more complex
	{{foo|arg1|arg2|arg...}} We can think of this as calling foo with args. 

Inside foo, we have access to the arguments as positional parameters
	{{{1}}} -> replaced by arg1 inside foo
	{{{2}}} -> replaced by arg2 inside foo

e.g. Identity with {{{1}}} inside.

{{Identity|xyz}} -> "xyz
