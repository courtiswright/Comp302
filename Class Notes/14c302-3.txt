{{ #expr | 5*3+2 }} -> "17"

Any expression that JS understands can be used.

When we process this, we evaluate the argument and get a string back.
	eval from JS : eval(a string) -> interprets it as JS
	Pass our string to eval -> computated result

Logical op:
{{ #expr | 3<5 }} -> true or false
